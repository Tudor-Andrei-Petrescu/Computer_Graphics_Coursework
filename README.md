# Computer Graphics coursework

The aim of this coursework was to create a basic rendering engine that can render in wireframe, ray trace, and rasterize.

### Some of the key features include:
-Orbiting and moving the camera along the X and Y coordinates
- Hard and soft shadows
- Different lightings(e.g. diffuse, ambient, specular)



- Phong and Gouraud shading
- Glass material

A demonstration of the engine can be seen below :
